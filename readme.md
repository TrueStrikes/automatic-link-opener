Setup:
1. Fill in your channel id you want to watch.
2. Fill in your token.
3. Fill in your browser launcher. Ex, for me it's: C:\Users\redacted\AppData\Local\Programs\Opera GX\launcher.exe
---
What this does is, it scans the given channel for roblox catalog links and if one comes up, it opens it in your browser. This works best combined with diseal for easy sniping on unannounced items
